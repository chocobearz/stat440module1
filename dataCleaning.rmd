Clean symptoms
```{r}
# Create a vector of symptoms, with each element corresponding to a symptom
words1 <- words_split(train1$symptoms, sep = "; ")

# Looking at the frequencies of the symptoms
sort(table(words1), decreasing = T)

# Get the unique symptoms
words2 <- words1 %>%
  unique() %>%
  # Replace the "℃" with "C"
  str_replace_all("℃", "C") %>%
  # Replace " ° " with " "
  str_replace_all(" ° ", " ")

# Initialize a dataframe
symptoms_df <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = nrow(train),
                                 ncol = length(words2)))
# Create column names from the unique symptoms
colnames(symptoms_df) <- words2

# Create the vectors for the columns
for( i in c( 1:length(words2) ) ){
  # Each column indicates if the word is present in the symptoms column
  symptoms_df[ , i] <- str_detect(train$symptoms, words2[i])
}

# Combine the original train data frame with the new symptoms data frame
train_full <- cbind(train, symptoms_df)

Dataframe cleaning function
```{r}

  # This function just applies all of the cleaning steps to the
  # Stat 440 module 1 covid data sets. The function accepts a dataframe
  # and outputs the cleaned dataframe.

  # to a symptom
  words1 <- words_split(df1$symptoms, sep = "; ")
  
  # Get the unique symptoms

    str_replace_all(" ° ", " ")
  
  # Initialize a dataframe
  symptoms_df <- data.frame(
    matrix(nrow = nrow(df1),

    symptoms_df[ , i] <- str_detect(df1$symptoms, words2[i])
  }
  # Combine the original train data frame with the new symptoms data frame

  # Remove the intermediate variables
  rm(symptoms_df, words1, words2)
  
  # Return the new dataframe
  return(df1)

Clean the other data sets
```{r}
# Old test set that had durations
test1 <- read.csv("data/test.txt")
# New test set for the new training set
test2 <- read.csv("data/test2.txt")
# Old training set
train1 <- read.csv("data/train.txt")

test1 <- clean_age_and_symptoms(test1)
test2 <- clean_age_and_symptoms(test2)
train1 <- clean_age_and_symptoms(train1)
