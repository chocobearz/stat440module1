Clean symptoms

Dataframe cleaning function
```{r}
clean_confirmed_age_and_symptoms <- function(df1){
  # This function just applies all of the cleaning steps to the
  # Stat 440 module 1 covid data sets. The function accepts a dataframe
  # and outputs the cleaned dataframe.
  library(purrr)
  library(dplyr)
  library(stringr)
  library(lubridate)
  source('range_to_mean.R')
  source('words_split.R')
  
  # Clean confirmed dates with lubridate
  df1$confirmed <- dmy(df1$confirmed)
  
  # Clean age ranges by converting age ranges to a single number
  df1$clean_age <- map_dbl(df1$age, range_to_mean)
  
  # Create a vector of symptoms, with each element corresponding
  # to a symptom
  words1 <- words_split(df1$symptoms, sep = "; ")
  
  # Get the unique symptoms
  words2 <- words1 %>%
    unique() %>%
    # Replace the "℃" with "C"
    str_replace_all("℃", "C") %>%
    # Replace " ° " with " "
    str_replace_all(" ° ", " ")
  
  # Initialize a dataframe
  symptoms_df <- data.frame(
    matrix(nrow = nrow(df1),
           ncol = length(words2))
    )
  # Create column names from the unique symptoms
  colnames(symptoms_df) <- words2
  
  # Create the vectors for the columns
  for( i in c( 1:length(words2) ) ){
    # Each column indicates if the word is present in the symptoms column
    symptoms_df[ , i] <- str_detect(df1$symptoms, words2[i])
  }
  # Combine the original train data frame with the new symptoms data frame
  df1 <- cbind(df1, symptoms_df)
  
  # Remove the intermediate variables
  rm(symptoms_df, words1, words2)
  
  # Return the new dataframe
  return(df1)
}
```

Clean the test data set
```{r}
# test2 <- read.csv("data/test2.txt")
# 
# test2 <- clean_confirmed_age_and_symptoms(test2)
# 
# test2$symptoms <- NULL
# test2$confirmed <- NULL
# 
# # Export the new test dataset
# write.csv(test2, "data/test2_cleaned.csv")
# 
# # Consideration: the new test data set might have indicator symptom
# # variables that aren't present in even the other three data sets.
```


Clean the other data sets
```{r}
# Copying the new training set
train_new <- read.csv("data/train2.txt")
# Remove the "outcome" column for merging purposes
train_new$outcome <- NULL

# Clean the df
train_new <- clean_confirmed_age_and_symptoms(train_new)

# Consideration: Not sure what to do with the outcome column in the
# old test set; not sure if they are actually all blank or missing

# Create a separate cleaned training set if we can't use old data
```

Fixing column issues
```{r}
# Merge the training and test data sets so that they all have the same
# columns

test2 <- read.csv("data/test2.txt")

test2$clean_age <- map_dbl(test2$age, range_to_mean)

test2$confirmed <- dmy(test2$confirmed)

# Create a vector of symptoms, with each element corresponding
# to a symptom
words1 <- words_split(train_new$symptoms, sep = "; ")
  
# Get the unique symptoms
words2 <- words1 %>%
  unique() %>%
  # Replace the "℃" with "C"
  str_replace_all("℃", "C") %>%
  # Replace " ° " with " "
  str_replace_all(" ° ", " ")
  
# Initialize a dataframe
symptoms_df <- data.frame(
  matrix(nrow = nrow(test2),
         ncol = length(words2))
  )

colnames(symptoms_df) <- words2
  
# Create the vectors for the columns
for( i in c( 1:length(words2) ) ){
  # Each column indicates if the word is present in the symptoms column
  symptoms_df[ , i] <- str_detect(test2$symptoms, words2[i])
}
# Combine the original train data frame with the new symptoms data frame
test2 <- cbind(test2, symptoms_df)
  
# Remove the intermediate variables
rm(symptoms_df, words1, words2, i)

# Add an empty duration column for test2
test2$duration <- as.numeric(NA)

# Remove the id column
test2$Id <- NULL

# Check the first few column names
head(colnames(train_new), 10)
head(colnames(test2), 10)

# Reorganize the columns
test2 <- cbind(test2[ , 1:8], duration = test2[, 59], test2[9:58])

# Check the first few column names
head(colnames(train_new), 10)
head(colnames(test2), 10)

# Fix column name issue
##colnames(test2)[65] <- "fever (38-39 C)"

# Merge the training and test datasets
full_df1 <- rbind(train_new, test2)

# Remove the old symptoms column
full_df1$symptoms <- NULL
```


Exporting to Python
```{r}
# Split the fully merged data set
train2 <- full_df1[0:219, ]
test2 <- full_df1[220:419, ]

# Export the merged data sets that all have duration
write.csv(train2, "data/train2.csv")

# Export the new test set
write.csv(test2, "data/test2.csv")
```
